      <h3>Kioru</h3>
      <p>Founder 2010 - 2021</p>
    </hgroup>
    <p></p>
    <tt>I co-founded a software factory with two university colleagues, where we developed everything from websites to
      full systems for local companies. From this venture, ideas like Parkuest and Saeko were born, which later became
      successful companies. We implemented cloud-based technology, enabling the connection of any device or system to
      provide real-time information. I led and managed a team of over 30 engineers, delivering solutions to more than
      150 clients. As a founder, I also played a key role in the administration and leadership of the organization.</tt>

      <h3>Parkuest</h3>
      <p>Founder 2012 - 2018</p>
    </hgroup>
    <p></p>
    <tt>I developed and led the implementation of Parkuest, a comprehensive parking guidance system. My work included
      the design and development of ultrasonic sensor technology, network structure, and the integration of PIC family
      microcontrollers. I coordinated the manufacturing of PCBs in China and their assembly in Mexico. Additionally, I
      designed and developed the plastic enclosures for the devices, created a proprietary communication protocol, and
      designed custom displays for real-time data visualization. The system was successfully installed in the World
      Trade Center in Paraguay, as well as in locations in Sydney and Mexico.</tt>

    <tt>Throughout my career and in my free time, I have developed a variety of projects that encompass both the
      technological
      field and the development of physical products and hardware. These projects have been driven by my passion for
      innovation and my desire to apply practical and efficient solutions in different areas. My experience ranges from
      creating software and mobile applications to designing and building physical devices, always with a focus on
      quality and
      functionality. <i><a href="./projects.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Projects">Read more</a></i></tt>
