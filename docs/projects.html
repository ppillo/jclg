        <summary>Mexican Lotería Mobile App</summary>
        <article>

              class="img-fluid" /></p>
          <p>The Mexican Lotería is a traditional and popular game, especially in the northern regions of Mexico, where
            families often gather to play together. My mother's family is from northern Mexico, and every time we visit
            them, our afternoons are filled with Lotería games with my aunts and cousins. One of my cousins, who shares
            my
            passion for technology, was likely inspired by these family gatherings to start developing a Lotería app.
            The
            primary feature of the app was to announce each card, a key function that Ricardo, my cousin, focused on
            when
            he first developed the mobile app.
          </p>
          <p>
            After some time, Ricardo joined me at Kioru, and during one of our follow-up sessions, he shared the
            growththe
            iOS apphad experienced. He expressed interest in expanding the app to Android. When he mentioned that the
            app
            hadsurpassed10,000 users, I was intrigued and offered my help to develop the app using React Native. This
            way,
            we couldhave asingle codebase for both iOS and Android.
          </p>
          <p>We kicked off the project in June 2024, and by July 15th, the app was live in the stores. It was a
            fantastic
            team effort. Ricardo had a clear vision of the features we needed to develop, and when I joined the project,
            I added functionalities like a game board so multiple people could play on their devices, not just the
            card announcement feature. Although we don’t consider ourselves top-notch technicians, we were able to
            develop
            the mobile app following best practices.</p>
          <p>
            Since launching the Android version, the app has seen consistent user growth, and after just one month,
            we’ve reached over 500 users. We aim to hit 50,000 users soon, and we’re excited to keep adding more
            features,
            as we have an ambitious roadmap ahead.
          </p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we see a huge potential market in the United States, where there are over 40 million
            Latinos. We believe this is a significant opportunity, and our business model is very straightforward. If we
            can reach just 10% of this market and offer a subscription service that removes ads for just one dollar a
            month, it would be an incredibly profitable venture.</p>

        <summary>Saeko - 1,200 schools </summary>
        <article>
          <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./images/projects/saeko/saeko.jpg" alt="Saeko" class="img-fluid" />
          </p>
          <p>
            After successfully creating and implementing Saeko for several private schools in the region where I grew up
            and studied, I had the fortune of meeting with the director of CECyTEs, a subsystem of upper secondary
            education in Mexico with over 1,200 campuses and an active enrollment of more than half a million students.
            We discussed the challenges faced by public education and the need for systems that could assist in
            decision-making. While Saeko was already being tested daily by several schools in the region, I was not
            going to miss the opportunity to offer it to the public system, which represents 20% of Mexico's public
            upper secondary education.
          </p>
          <p>
            The director trusted the vision I shared about centralizing all school processes into a single, nationwide
            platform. She granted me a meeting in December 2014. By February 2015, we had held several discussions with
            various states, and it was agreed to implement Saeko with the promise of issuing electronic certificates by
            July 2015. This was a significant challenge, as we not only needed to implement the tool to manage the
            administrative processes of the active student enrollment, but we also had to import all student history to
            issue certificates with final grades for all subjects over the last three years, the typical duration of
            upper secondary education in Mexico.
          </p>
          <p>
            We conducted a nationwide training campaign, meeting in the capital of each state with school administration
            officials to implement Saeko. We traveled to more than 30 states, sometimes training groups of over 100
            people in auditoriums. States like Michoacán, Tlaxcala, Querétaro, Baja California Sur, and Yucatán are
            still our clients today.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project brought great benefits and personal satisfaction, as we met thousands of users and were
            delighted to hear that the platform was comprehensive and met all the needs of the schools for proper
            administration. Among the problems we solved was enabling the government to accurately track the number of
            campuses, the study programs being offered, and the active enrollment.
          </p>

        <summary>Volunteer - Aquaponic system </summary>
        <p>An aquaponic system for my local community garden. I joined as a volunteer and I was shocked by how much
          water they used for gardening. I thought: surely I can do something to grow veggies without wasting water.</p>

        <p>I started searching on the internet and following some YouTube channels about aquaponics. Then I read books
          about it and finally, I found a guy in Queensland, Australia who had made a system with an IBC cube. I had no
          tools, no money or experience but I decided to present the idea to the community garden committee.</p>

        <p>Amazingly, they were interested in the preliminary idea and decided to approve a small budget. So I set to
          work. I found the IBC cube on Facebook Marketplace. I contacted my brother-in-law to collect the cube in his
          truck and deliver it to the community garden. I dug a hole to bury the cube in and keep the water and fish
          warm in the winter, I cut the cube (5000L), I hooked up the pump and electricity, I researched and bought the
          clay for the gardenbed, and lastly I found 12 fish to fertilise the water and help the lettuce to grow.</p>

        <p>After around three months, I completed the project and it has been running for more than five years keeping
          12 fish alive and providing plenty of lettuces and other herbs and veggies for community garden members to
          eat. When I had finished the system, Ken, one of the long-serving volunteers, commented to me that a lot of
          people arrive with big ideas for the garden but never follow through. He was shocked and impressed!
